# Data Analysis CouseWork (MSc Artificial Intelligence and Robotics)
Welcome to the repository for my MSc coursework on Machine Learning and Neural Networks. This project encompasses a range of techniques and methodologies central to understanding and applying machine learning principles. From dimensionality reduction and clustering to sophisticated classification strategies, this coursework represents a comprehensive exploration of the machine-learning landscape.

### Features
* __PCA Analysis:__ Utilized the MATLAB-based toolbox Netlab for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), enabling the reduction of dimensionality for dataset visualization and analysis.
* __K-Means Clustering:__ Implemented K-Means clustering to identify distinct groups within datasets, facilitating insightful data categorization.
* __Image Compression:__ Employed PCA for effective image compression, demonstrating the utility of machine learning in reducing data storage without significantly compromising quality.
* __Data Visualization:__ Visualized high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces to uncover patterns and insights using PCA.
* __SVM Classification:__ Conducted classification tasks using Support Vector Machines (SVM), incorporating normalization, cross-validation, and classification techniques to optimize performance.
* __Classification Analysis:__ Analyzed classification results to identify and understand misclassified data, providing valuable feedback loops for model refinement.

### Technology Used
  * MATLAB
  * Netlab
  * LibSVM
